- <b>Target:</b> >=WoW 1.12
- <b>Requirements:</b> [CL_Library](https://github.com/CoderLotl/CL_Library).
- <b>Version:</b> Alpha 1.0
- <b>Description:</b> A simple 1st version of a guild GPS.

<b>Further Detail:</b>

A simple addon intended for sharing one's position with the own guild, making the own character visible for anyone in the guild using the same addon in the map.

<b>Currently</b> the addon allows only to see other characters at some location's map <i>(example: Mulgore, Durotar, Moonglade...)</i>, but not in the continental or global view.
That means that if you're at <i>Tirisfal Glades</i> and some of your guild mates is at <i>Tanaris</i>, you can see their location as if you both were in a party and they can see yours.

<b>TODO:</b>
- Add a tooltip to each dot on the map to display the character's name.
- Add capital cities.
- Add an option for disabling the position sharing (for those who want to hide from their guilds, for whatever reasons and time).
